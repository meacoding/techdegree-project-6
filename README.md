# Word Game - Techdegree FEWD Project 6

A word game similar to Hangman.  



## Technologies and skills used 

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript

## Reason for creation
To build a word game with JavaScript for the Treehouse Techdegree FEWD program.

## What I did

This project matches the mockup provided with some flourishes. JavaScript drives the interactivity. Per directions, for large screens only.
 
## Backstory

Pure and simple, this project was an exercise in JavaScript. This classic word game can only be played with one of two devices⁠—the mouse or keyboard. Supporting both devices was one of the two challenges. The other was in discovering ways the user could "break" the game or cheat. 

The person who reviewed my project submission congratulated me on finding one of the ways of user cheating—select all. This seemed an obvious thing I'd need to prevent because I know just because text isn't visible doesn't mean it's not there. Disabling text selection was key. Unfortunately, I know the user can always inspect the code to reveal the answers, whether they press F12 or through a menu.
