## Technologies and skills used 

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript

## Reason for creation
To build a word game with JavaScript for the Treehouse Techdegree FEWD program.

## What I did

JavaScript drives the interactivity. For large screens only. Matches provided mockup with some flourishes.
 
## Backstory

Pure and simple, this project was an exercise in JavaScript. This classic word game can only be played with one of two devices⁠—the mouse or keyboard. Supporting both devices was one of the two challenges. The other was in discovering ways the user could "break" the game or cheat. 

The person who reviewed my project submission congratulated me on finding one of the ways of user cheating—select all. This seemed an obvious thing I'd need to prevent because I know invisible text is selectable text. Disabling text selection was key. Unfortunately, I know the user can always inspect the code to reveal the answers, whether they press F12 or through a menu.

## License
None.
